This directory contains some Percy++ test sets for comparing against our scheme.

To run the tests: 

1. extract the ntl and percy archives. 

2. build and install ntl (see instructions within).

3. build and extract percy (see instructions within, might require installing
additional dependencies.)

4. from within the percy directory run "./runtestset testsets/boosted-baseline/*.test".
