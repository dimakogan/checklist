This directory contains some information and test sets for comparing our scheme
to Percy++ and SealPIR.

* SealPIR - unfortunately, SealPIR is very sensitive to the version of
Microsoft SEAL are the HEAD of the former does not work with the HEAD of the
latter. The following commits work together.
 1. git clone http://github.com/Microsoft/SEAL
    git checkout fa57e4e98242a15cd2bd8c56987c299e0baf5fa2
 2. git clone http://github.com/Microsoft/SealPIR
    git checkout 043aa0b01646473a7fe5a577c3896729a5662c88
See the README of SEAL for installation instructions.    
To improve the performance of SealPIR, it looks like it is worth changing d from
5 to 2 in main.cpp.

* Percy++ - need to install (on Ubuntu): 
    NTL, libgcrypt20-dev, libsocket++-dev, `pip install paramiko' 

To run the tests: 

1. extract the ntl and percy archives. 

2. build and install ntl (see instructions within).

3. build and extract percy (see instructions within, might require installing
additional dependencies.)

4. from within the percy directory run "./runtestset testsets/boosted-baseline/*.test".
